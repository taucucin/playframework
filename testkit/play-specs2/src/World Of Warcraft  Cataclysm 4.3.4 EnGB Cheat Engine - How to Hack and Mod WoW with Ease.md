Once you have launched both programs, switch to Cheat Engine and click on the "Select a process to open" button on the top left corner of the window. This will open a list of all the processes running on your computer. Look for "Wow.exe" or "Wow-64.exe" depending on your system architecture and click on it. Then click on "Open". This will attach Cheat Engine to WoW's process.
 
## Step 3: Scan for Values
 
Now that you have attached Cheat Engine to WoW's process, you can start scanning for values that you want to modify. For example, if you want to change your character's speed, you need to scan for your current speed value in WoW's memory.
 
To do this, switch to WoW and move your character around for a few seconds. Then switch back to Cheat Engine and enter your current speed value in the "Value" box under "Scan Type". Make sure you select "Exact Value" as the scan type and "Float" as the value type. Then click on "First Scan". This will scan WoW's memory for any addresses that match your current speed value.
 
After the scan is done, you will see a list of addresses and values on the left panel of Cheat Engine. These are the possible matches for your current speed value. However, there might be too many matches to work with, so you need to narrow them down by changing your speed value in WoW and scanning again.
 
To do this, switch back to WoW and move your character around again for a few seconds. Then switch back to Cheat Engine and enter your new speed value in the "Value" box under "Scan Type". Make sure you select "Next Scan" instead of "First Scan". This will scan WoW's memory again for any addresses that match your new speed value.
 
Repeat this process until you have only one or a few addresses left on the left panel of Cheat Engine. These are the addresses that control your speed value in WoW.
