## Benefits of EasyRoads3D Pro v3
 
EasyRoads3D Pro v3 has many benefits that make it a valuable tool for creating road networks and other procedural infrastructures inside Unity. Some of these benefits are:

- It is easy to use and intuitive. You can create roads by simply clicking and dragging on the terrain. You can also adjust the width, height, curvature, texture and other properties of the roads with sliders and handles.
- It has built-in customizable crossings that allow you to create realistic intersections and junctions. You can also import your own crossing models and use them in your road network.
- It has a variety of side objects that you can add to your roads, such as bridges, guard rails, fences, walls, power lines, tree lines and more. You can also create your own custom shapes for other infrastructures like railroads and rivers.
- It has a smart terrain system that conforms the terrain to the shape of the roads, removes grass and trees near the roads, and optionally bakes the road shape in the terrain splatmap. This creates a seamless integration between the roads and the terrain.
- It has a scripting API that allows you to create roads through code both in the Unity editor and at runtime. This gives you more flexibility and control over your road network.
