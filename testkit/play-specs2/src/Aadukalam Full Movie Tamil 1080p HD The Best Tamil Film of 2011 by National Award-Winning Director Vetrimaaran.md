Aadukalam is based on a real-life incident that Vetrimaaran witnessed in his childhood. He spent four years researching and writing the script, which he initially planned to make as his debut film. However, due to budget constraints and casting issues, he made Polladhavan (2007) first and then returned to Aadukalam. He chose Dhanush as the lead actor because of their rapport and mutual trust. Dhanush underwent rigorous training to learn the nuances of rooster fighting and the Madurai dialect.
 
The film was shot in various locations in Tamil Nadu, including Madurai, Theni, Dindigul and Tirunelveli. The cinematography by Velraj captured the rustic beauty and the harsh realities of the rural setting. The editing by Kishore T.E. enhanced the pace and the tension of the film. The sound design by T. Udhayakumar and Dhanush Raja created a realistic and immersive audio experience. The film also featured live roosters in the fight sequences, which were supervised by animal welfare activists.
 
Aadukalam was released on 14 January 2011 and received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike. It was a commercial success as well, grossing over â¹500 million at the box office. The film was also screened at various international film festivals, such as the Toronto International Film Festival, the London Indian Film Festival and the Mumbai Film Festival. The film was remade in Sinhala as Ran Kevita 2 (2013) and in Bengali as Cockpit (2017).
  
Aadukalam is not just a film about rooster fighting, but also a film about human emotions, relationships and ambitions. The film explores the themes of love, friendship, betrayal, revenge and redemption. The film also depicts the socio-cultural aspects of the rural community, such as caste, religion, politics and violence. The film challenges the stereotypes and prejudices associated with the rooster fighters and shows their passion and pride for their profession.
